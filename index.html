<H1>Consoley!</H1>
<p><em>v. 0.002 alpha</em></p>
<P>This is Consoley, a tookit for beginning Debian users, (and users of Debian-based distros, like Ubuntu and Linux Mint), to install some of the most popular and useful programs for Linux.</P>

<P>As you can see, it doesn't work completely! But it will soon!  It generates the code for apt-get packages, but I need to add special code for packages that are not part of the debian apt-get repository. Those have been crossed out for the meantime.</P>

<P>Current bugs on Ubuntu:</P>
<code>
Note, selecting 'mate-desktop-environment' instead of 'mate'<BR>
Note, selecting 'firefox' instead of 'iceweasel'<BR>
Package icedove is not available, but is referred to by another package.<BR>
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or<BR>
is only available from another source<BR>
<BR>
Package chromium is not available, but is referred to by another package.<BR>
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or<BR>
is only available from another source<BR>
However the following packages replace it:<BR>
  chromium-bsu:i386 chromium-bsu<BR>

Package kde-standard is not available, but is referred to by another package.<BR>
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or<BR>
is only available from another source<BR>
