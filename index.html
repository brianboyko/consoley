<H1>Consoley!</H1>
<p><em>v. 0.002 alpha</em></p>
<P>This is Consoley, a tookit for beginning Debian users, (and users of Debian-based distros, like Ubuntu and Linux Mint), to install some of the most popular and useful programs for Linux.</P>

<P>As you can see, it doesn't work completely! But it will soon!  It generates the code for apt-get packages, but I need to add special code for packages that are not part of the debian apt-get repository. Those have been crossed out for the meantime.</P>
