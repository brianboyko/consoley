    <h1>Consoley!</h1>

    <p><em>v. 0.002 alpha</em></p>

    <p>This is Consoley, a tookit for beginning Debian users, (and users of
    Debian-based distros, like Ubuntu and Linux Mint), to install some of the
    most popular and useful programs for Linux.</p>

    <p>As you can see, it doesn't work completely! But it will soon! It
    generates the code for apt-get packages, but I need to add special code for
    packages that are not part of the debian apt-get repository. Those have
    been crossed out for the meantime.</p><!--
