  <p>This is Consoley, a tookit for beginning Linux users that allows
        them to install some of the most popular programs for Linux with a
        single action</p>



        <h3>How to use Consoley</h3>

        <p>First, choose your distribution. Right now, Consoley supports Linux
        Mint, Ubuntu based-distributions, and Debian. This will generate a list
        of programs you can use to get started.</p>

        <p>Next, browse through the list, and click on any programs you want to
        install. When you've selected all the programs you want, go ahead and
        copy the code in the "code" window, and just paste it into a terminal.
        It will prompt you for your root password and ask you if you want to
        install - just type "y" (for "yes") and hit enter. You're on your
        way.</p>

        <h3>How does it work?</h3>

        <p>Consoley isn't really all that magical. The <i>real</i> magic
        happens because of the apt-get repositories - part of Debian-based
        Linux installations. This allows you to install any program that Debian
        knows of simply by calling it's name. Any dependencies (programs you
        need to install before you install the program you want to install!)
        are configured automatically! Neat!</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Why don't you have (program X)?</h3>

        <p>The great thing about apt-get is that you don't have to worry about conflicts or dependencies on different Linux systems. But if a package isn't in the apt-get repositories, it can be extremely difficult to write a code that will install on all Linux boxes, everywhere. So many popular programs, such as Skype, the official release of Chrome, etc., are not included.  You can still install these packages from their respective websites.</p>
        <P> If a package <em>is</em> in the repositories, however, and I don't have it listed here, and you think it should be, e-mail me at <a href="mailto:brian@sendthisguytocodecampe.com">brian@sendthisguytocodecamp.com</a>. I can add it relatively quickly because all the data is dynamically generated from a JSON file.</P>
